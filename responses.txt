When you make an HTTP request using Python (or any other method), the server responds with an **HTTP status code**. You got `<Response [200]>`, which means **the request was successful**.

### **Common HTTP Response Codes**
Here are some other responses you might get while scraping:

#### ✅ **Success Codes (2xx)**
- **200 OK** → The request was successful.
- **201 Created** → A new resource was successfully created (usually in APIs).
- **204 No Content** → The request was successful, but there's no data to return.

#### 🔀 **Redirection Codes (3xx)**
- **301 Moved Permanently** → The page has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found (Temporary Redirect)** → The page is temporarily moved.
- **304 Not Modified** → The resource hasn’t changed since the last request.

#### ❌ **Client Error Codes (4xx)**
- **400 Bad Request** → The request was malformed.
- **401 Unauthorized** → Authentication is required.
- **403 Forbidden** → You **don’t have permission** to access the resource (common in scraping!).
- **404 Not Found** → The page does not exist.
- **429 Too Many Requests** → You are sending too many requests; the server is blocking you (rate limiting).

#### 🔥 **Server Error Codes (5xx)**
- **500 Internal Server Error** → The server crashed while processing your request.
- **502 Bad Gateway** → The server received an invalid response from another server.
- **503 Service Unavailable** → The server is overloaded or undergoing maintenance.
- **504 Gateway Timeout** → The server did not respond in time.

### **How to Check Response Codes in Python**
You can print and handle different response codes in your scraping script like this:

```python
import requests

url = "https://scrapethissite.com/"
response = requests.get(url)

print(f"Response Code: {response.status_code}")

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Success! The page loaded correctly.")
elif response.status_code == 403:
    print("Access forbidden! The website is blocking scrapers.")
elif response.status_code == 404:
    print("Page not found!")
elif response.status_code == 429:
    print("Too many requests! Slow down.")
else:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {response.status_code}")
```
